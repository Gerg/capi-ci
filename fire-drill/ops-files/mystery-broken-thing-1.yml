# ################## Answer #####################
#
# The Operator accidentally swapped out the CC Uploader
# TLS cert for the statsdinjector cert. This caused
# all droplet uploads to fail as the communication
# between CC Uploader and CC was busted.
#
# Clues:
#
# While the error is Staging Failed, we see a bunch of
# successful staging logs when pushing the app like
# "Downloading buildpack..." and "Staging complete".
# This indicates that Diego recieved our staging request
# and was able to process it. This hints that the
# problem is between either Diego and CC Uploader or
# CC Uploader to CC.
#
# To check your answer, you could have run:
# `openssl verify -verbose -CAfile cc-ca.pem cc-uploader.crt`
# This will tell you that CC Uploader TLS cert was not
# signed for the CC CA.
